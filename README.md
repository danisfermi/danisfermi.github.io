# { Personal } Jekyll Theme

{ Personal } is a free responsive Jekyll theme, derived from [here](https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/). It has tons of features and I highly recommend it to use as a starting point for your blog. It can be highly customized with minimal knowledge of web technologies and is well documented and noob-friendly.
