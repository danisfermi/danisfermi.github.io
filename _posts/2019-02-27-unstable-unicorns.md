So recently, it was my roommate's birthday, and I got to play this card game, called Unstable Unicorns. Yeah, I know what you are thinking. Unicorns huh? How cheesy is that? Well, I was of the same opinion. That is until I started playing it.

It's a truly epic game. The target is simple: build a stable of 7 unicorns. The first one to do it wins. But things are not so straightforward. There are powerful upgrade and downgrade cards and special trigger effects that add a whole new dimension to the game. It's full of twists and turns, counters and counter-counters, and the endless cycle of hope, dissapointment, the feeling that your sole purpose now is to wreck the game for as many people as possible and then hope again.

Watch the full tutorial on how to play the game or read it <a href="https://www.unstableunicorns.com/pages/rules" target="_blank">here</a>. It has a small learning curve, but trust me, it's well worth the effort; you are gonna enjoy it so much.

Ok, let me give an example of a sick move I pulled - the next level play. So I reached the 5 unicorn mark and I knew that my fellow players would hit me with a downgrade card to prevent my victory. And the most dangerous downgrade card in play was the Tiny Stable - you are required to sacrifice a Unicorn any time you have more than 5 unicorns in your stable. Pre-emptively, I added a Unicorn lasso upgrade card - it lets me pull a unicorn from any other player's stable at the start of my turn and return it. My fellow players thought my move was just to steal a unicorn when I had 6 unicorns and sneak a win, so they din't neigh it. As expected, I was hit with the Tiny Stable. On my turn, I pulled a unicorn from said friend's stable that removes a specific upgrade/downgrade card from any player and adds it to my hand (trigerred effects take priority over the effects of Tiny Stable). It was epic stuff, like when Mike Ross pulls off a series of moves that cause a butterfly effect. This opens a variety of combinations to counter Tiny Stable. Like using Unicorn Lasso and Unicorn Swap. Now that right there is a what I call a wombo combo. I can't wait to play again - maybe someone will make an online version of the game so I can play it anytime ;)
